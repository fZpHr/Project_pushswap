## Push Swap

Push Swap is a 42 project where you implement a sorting algorithm for an array of integers using two stacks and a set of predefined operations. The goal is to sort the array with the minimum number of operations. This project helps reinforce your understanding of algorithmic complexity, data structures, and problem-solving skills.

*For more information, please refer to the subject in the git.*

## Installation

To install Push Swap, clone the project from the Git repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:fZpHr/pushswap_42.git
cd pushswap_42
```

Then compile the executable using the provided Makefile:

```bash
make
```

## Usage

To run Push Swap, execute the following command:

```bash
./push_swap <list_of_integers>
```

## Example

Here is an example of how to use Push Swap:

```bash
./push_swap 4 2 1 3
```

## Description

The program will output a series of instructions to sort the input list of integers. It will use a combination of stack operations such as swap, push, and rotate to achieve the desired sorting order.
